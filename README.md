# A window based GBRT Regressor, attempting to model time series and make prediction.

## Introduction
Use GBRT to make time series prediction, now using lightGBM as the base.
Support optuna to look for the optimize hyperparameters.

## Requirement

## Usage
The usage of class and configuration is demonstrated in the sample file.

```
python wLGBM_optuna_sample.py
```

## Todo list
Support other GBRT models, e.g. XGBoost, Catboost.
